    title: "Let’s Talk about the 8th wonder of the world",
    description:
      "<p>Albert Einstein once said “Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. <strong>He who understands it, earns it; he who doesn’t, pays it.”</strong></p><p>Trust me, it’s easier to understand than you think it is not some financial technical term, it’s a pretty easy concept and knowing it will help you grow your money, think long-term and help you think harder before jumping into any “good” sounding debt (we’ll get more into that another day).</p><p>To keep it simple compound interest is interest on your interest. Simple interest is the amount earned at the end of the year the principal plus interest.</p><p>for example, 100,000 ksh in your savings earning 2% interest rate per annum and you leave it for one year (bank interest rates are quite low) so at the end of the year your money is at 102,00 KSH you’re probably hardly batting an eyelid at that interest rate. The problem with this, is if you are looking to save and not touch that money anytime soon than it isn’t doing much for you because your money is not beating the inflation rate, your money is losing value over time. That is something to consider look into money market funds (pretty low risk) which give better interest rates currently from 6-10% per annum (that’s way better than 2% right?) especially if you’re not looking to touch the money for some time.</p><p>But, compound interest is when you consistently leave the 100,000 KSH to grow and earn interest on your interest. That is when you start seeing the money rolling in and doesn’t it feel awesome! You are basically earning free money it does not get better than that! Before you start balling out you have to pace yourself it takes some time and you got to play for the long-term for example:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2% interest per annum:</strong></p><p>Year 1: 100,000 KSH &nbsp; = 102,000 KSH</p><p>Year 2: 102,000 KSH &nbsp; = 104,040 KSH</p><p>Year 3: 104,040 KSH &nbsp; = 106,121. KSH</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>8% interest per annum:</strong></p><p>Year 1: 100,000 KSH&nbsp; = 108,000 KSH</p><p>Year 2: 108,000 KSH&nbsp; = 116,640 KSH</p><p>Year 3: 125,971 KSH&nbsp; = 125,971 KSH</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The great words of Warren Buffett <strong>“If you don’t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.”</strong></p><p>This sounds cool, how does it work?</p><p>Compound interest accumulates over time and the more money you deposit the higher the interest rate which is the better for you! The key is to keep adding to your principal per month or bi-weekly or if you’re a lump-sum type of person than planning to deposit bigger amounts quarterly or every half-of the year. Being consistent is key and when the account starts looking juicy remember the goal for that money. Avoid aimlessly saving have a purpose for that saving or else you may be tempted to aimlessly spend.</p><p>I hope this makes compound interest simpler to understand and that it gets you excited to start making it work for you.&nbsp; Remember, to keep adding to your principal, consistency and patience will take you a mighty long way. The best time to start investing was yesterday the next best time is today.</p>",

    title: "3 Bad Debts to Watch",
    description:
      "<p>Debt simply refers to the state of owing money; this can either be to a person or an institution. Contrary to popular belief, not all debt is bad, but we shall get into that in a later article.</p><p>Let’s begin with a disclaimer, shall we? There is no shame around getting into bad debt because life happens. Holding on to the guilt and shame of being in debt only drags one down and discourages them from making better decisions.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What is bad debt?</strong></p><p>Simply put, it is debt that gives no lasting value; it loses its value the moment you get it. Meaning, whatever the bad debt is, it does not appreciate nor gain profit to give you more than what you borrowed.</p><p>Here are some examples:</p><ol><li><strong>Credit Cards</strong></li></ol><p>Disclaimer: Not all credit card debt is bad!&nbsp;</p><p>A credit card can help build up your credit score, which is useful when looking to get a mortgage or bigger loan for purposes such as business. Having a healthy relationship with credit generally does good than harm in the long run.</p><p>However, if not used wisely, it can be detrimental to your financial wellness. The thing about credit cards is that they give you instant access to your desires, without having to think long and hard about it. Therefore, without any discipline, it can be a slippery slope of poor impulsive decisions.&nbsp;</p><p>Having knowledge of the interest rate on the credit card plus any extra interest from late fees is crucial. In fact, if more individuals had an idea of how costly this can get, many of us would think twice about owning credit cards.&nbsp;</p><p>Pro Tip: The best way to avoid incurring extra credit costs is to pay the balance before the due date to avoid any interest, if possible, or making extra payments to help keep your interest charge low.</p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Payday Loans&nbsp;</strong></p><p>This refers to taking out a short-term loan to get you through a difficult time, with the knowledge that payday is just around the corner (perhaps two weeks away). In the moment, when the pressure is high, it does not seem like a horrible idea.&nbsp;</p><p>Consequently, you post-date a cheque in the hope that you will pay back once you receive your salary. Seems harmless, right? Well, WRONG! The catch with these payday loans is that the interest charged is quite high&nbsp; in such a short time.</p><p>Taking these loans frequently is an expensive affair that should be avoided at all costs.&nbsp;</p><p>Pro Tip: Consider building an emergency fund to help cushion you in tough times to avoid getting into debt that does not add value.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; <strong>3. Auto-mobile Loans&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A brother/sister has got to get to work, right? Having a car will make transportation generally easier. However, when taking out a loan to purchase a car, it is easy to be swayed by luxury cars, rather than sticking to what you originally had in mind.&nbsp;</p><p>Although the interest rates for an auto loan are usually low, remember to take into consideration that a car is a depreciating asset, therefore, what you get it for is not what you will be able to sell it for.&nbsp;</p><p>Pro Tip: If you are in this position, plan in advance to purchase the make and model of car that best fits within your budget, and plan to pay on time. Additionally, you are the buyer; ask as many questions as you would like and get to know if there are any additional (hidden) fees aside from the interest rate.</p><p>Do your research before getting into any of the above debts, not necessarily avoiding them like the plague but being careful what it is your getting yourself into, make sure it works for you and won’t leave you in a pile of high interest debt.</p>",

    description:
      "<p>You could be the best at spotting opportunities, but the worst at being patient in riding out the ups and downs of your investments. By identifying your money personality, you are able to understand and embrace your emotional responses, beliefs and behaviour towards money, learning how to improve the not-so-good aspects. Notice I did not say “change” but instead, to be aware and create an understanding of the pitfalls of each personality.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol><li>The Compulsive Saver</li></ol><ul><li>Saves endlessly without necessarily having a goal in mind&nbsp;</li><li>Is frugal&nbsp;</li><li>Saving gives them a sense of security&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Negative:</strong> Can go through life being overly cautious to the point that they never take part in any risk. This means losing out on good investment opportunities (there is always some risk attached to investing). They may also miss out on creating memorable experiences in an attempt to scrape every penny.</p><p><strong>Tip:</strong> Money is energy and it must flow. Hoarding only stops this flow. Always remember that spending on what you love, within reasonable limit, creates memories.</p><ol><li>The Compulsive Spender</li></ol><ul><li>Spends impulsively&nbsp;</li><li>Loves treating people&nbsp;</li><li>Seeks immediate gratification&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Negative</strong>: Tends to live beyond their means and enjoys going on shopping sprees.

I was able to keep track of how much I was spending as making a wholesale purchase of food rather from the supermarket getting vegetables at the market , asking myself over and over do I really want to purchase certain items or do I really need these Items. And lastly i really did save more! The Challenge was great hope to have more and more coming. Thank you once again Manuella Kind Regards",

      "Hi Njambi! I hope you are doing well and are having a good week! Thank you again for putting on the 10-day No Spend Challenge. This was the first of its kind that I have done before in order to keep track of my spending habits and focus on what is a necessity rather than a want. The 10 days really accomplished this and helped me not only realize how many non-budget spendings I do, but also how I need to build consistency in making a budget and sticking to it. This challenge gave me great next steps (learning how to budget effectively being the main one) to take to be able to manage my finances well. What resources or advice do you have in regards to budgeting? I have seen your posts on figuring finance and would definitely like to lean into them. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed the stretch this challenge gave - didn't feel impossible but definitely pushed and brought a much needed challenge. Thank you again for spearheading this! Have a great week and I look forward to hearing from you! Best,",
