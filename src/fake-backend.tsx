    title: "Let’s Talk about the 8th wonder of the world",
    description:
      "<p>Albert Einstein once said “Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. <strong>He who understands it, earns it; he who doesn’t, pays it.”</strong></p><p>Trust me, it’s easier to understand than you think it is not some financial technical term, it’s a pretty easy concept and knowing it will help you grow your money, think long-term and help you think harder before jumping into any “good” sounding debt (we’ll get more into that another day).</p><p>To keep it simple compound interest is interest on your interest. Simple interest is the amount earned at the end of the year the principal plus interest.</p><p>for example, 100,000 ksh in your savings earning 2% interest rate per annum and you leave it for one year (bank interest rates are quite low) so at the end of the year your money is at 102,00 KSH you’re probably hardly batting an eyelid at that interest rate. The problem with this, is if you are looking to save and not touch that money anytime soon than it isn’t doing much for you because your money is not beating the inflation rate, your money is losing value over time. That is something to consider look into money market funds (pretty low risk) which give better interest rates currently from 6-10% per annum (that’s way better than 2% right?) especially if you’re not looking to touch the money for some time.</p><p>But, compound interest is when you consistently leave the 100,000 KSH to grow and earn interest on your interest. That is when you start seeing the money rolling in and doesn’t it feel awesome! You are basically earning free money it does not get better than that! Before you start balling out you have to pace yourself it takes some time and you got to play for the long-term for example:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2% interest per annum:</strong></p><p>Year 1: 100,000 KSH &nbsp; = 102,000 KSH</p><p>Year 2: 102,000 KSH &nbsp; = 104,040 KSH</p><p>Year 3: 104,040 KSH &nbsp; = 106,121. KSH</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>8% interest per annum:</strong></p><p>Year 1: 100,000 KSH&nbsp; = 108,000 KSH</p><p>Year 2: 108,000 KSH&nbsp; = 116,640 KSH</p><p>Year 3: 125,971 KSH&nbsp; = 125,971 KSH</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The great words of Warren Buffett <strong>“If you don’t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.”</strong></p><p>This sounds cool, how does it work?</p><p>Compound interest accumulates over time and the more money you deposit the higher the interest rate which is the better for you! The key is to keep adding to your principal per month or bi-weekly or if you’re a lump-sum type of person than planning to deposit bigger amounts quarterly or every half-of the year. Being consistent is key and when the account starts looking juicy remember the goal for that money. Avoid aimlessly saving have a purpose for that saving or else you may be tempted to aimlessly spend.</p><p>I hope this makes compound interest simpler to understand and that it gets you excited to start making it work for you.&nbsp; Remember, to keep adding to your principal, consistency and patience will take you a mighty long way. The best time to start investing was yesterday the next best time is today.</p>",

    title: "3 Bad Debts to Watch",
    description:
      "<p>Debt simply refers to the state of owing money; this can either be to a person or an institution. Contrary to popular belief, not all debt is bad, but we shall get into that in a later article.</p><p>Let’s begin with a disclaimer, shall we? There is no shame around getting into bad debt because life happens. Holding on to the guilt and shame of being in debt only drags one down and discourages them from making better decisions.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What is bad debt?</strong></p><p>Simply put, it is debt that gives no lasting value; it loses its value the moment you get it. Meaning, whatever the bad debt is, it does not appreciate nor gain profit to give you more than what you borrowed.</p><p>Here are some examples:</p><ol><li><strong>1. Credit Cards</strong></li></ol><p>Disclaimer: Not all credit card debt is bad!&nbsp;</p><p>A credit card can help build up your credit score, which is useful when looking to get a mortgage or bigger loan for purposes such as business. Having a healthy relationship with credit generally does good than harm in the long run.</p><p>However, if not used wisely, it can be detrimental to your financial wellness. The thing about credit cards is that they give you instant access to your desires, without having to think long and hard about it. Therefore, without any discipline, it can be a slippery slope of poor impulsive decisions.&nbsp;</p><p>Having knowledge of the interest rate on the credit card plus any extra interest from late fees is crucial. In fact, if more individuals had an idea of how costly this can get, many of us would think twice about owning credit cards.&nbsp;</p><p>Pro Tip: The best way to avoid incurring extra credit costs is to pay the balance before the due date to avoid any interest, if possible, or making extra payments to help keep your interest charge low.</p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Payday Loans&nbsp;</strong></p><p>This refers to taking out a short-term loan to get you through a difficult time, with the knowledge that payday is just around the corner (perhaps two weeks away). In the moment, when the pressure is high, it does not seem like a horrible idea.&nbsp;</p><p>Consequently, you post-date a cheque in the hope that you will pay back once you receive your salary. Seems harmless, right? Well, WRONG! The catch with these payday loans is that the interest charged is quite high&nbsp; in such a short time.</p><p>Taking these loans frequently is an expensive affair that should be avoided at all costs.&nbsp;</p><p>Pro Tip: Consider building an emergency fund to help cushion you in tough times to avoid getting into debt that does not add value.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; <strong>3. Auto-mobile Loans&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A brother/sister has got to get to work, right? Having a car will make transportation generally easier. However, when taking out a loan to purchase a car, it is easy to be swayed by luxury cars, rather than sticking to what you originally had in mind.&nbsp;</p><p>Although the interest rates for an auto loan are usually low, remember to take into consideration that a car is a depreciating asset, therefore, what you get it for is not what you will be able to sell it for.&nbsp;</p><p>Pro Tip: If you are in this position, plan in advance to purchase the make and model of car that best fits within your budget, and plan to pay on time. Additionally, you are the buyer; ask as many questions as you would like and get to know if there are any additional (hidden) fees aside from the interest rate.</p><p>Do your research before getting into any of the above debts, not necessarily avoiding them like the plague but being careful what it is your getting yourself into, make sure it works for you and won’t leave you in a pile of high interest debt.</p>",

    description:
      "<p>You could be the best at spotting opportunities, but the worst at being patient in riding out the ups and downs of your investments. By identifying your money personality, you are able to understand and embrace your emotional responses, beliefs and behaviour towards money, learning how to improve the not-so-good aspects. Notice I did not say “change” but instead, to be aware and create an understanding of the pitfalls of each personality.&nbsp;</p> <ol> <li>1.

This means losing out on good investment opportunities (there is always some risk attached to investing). They may also miss out on creating memorable experiences in an attempt to scrape every penny.</p> <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Money is energy and it must flow. Hoarding only stops this flow. Always remember that spending on what you love, within reasonable limit, creates memories.</p> <ol> <li>2.

This isn’t necessarily a bad thing. However, if they do not take care of their finances, they may end up living financially strenuous lives.</p> <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Plan for your financial future to avoid stress and understand that money is a tool to get you where you want to go.</p> <ol> <li>5. The Saver-Splurger</li> </ol> <ul> <li>Saves but also occasionally gives in to impulse spending</li> <li>Shares common traits with Savers and Spenders</li> <li>Sometimes digs into savings for things they don’t necessarily need</li> </ul> <p><strong>Negative:</strong> They tend to feel emotionally exhausted and worry about money. This is because they work so hard to save, only to get distracted and later splurge, creating an uneasy feeling.</p> <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Remind yourself often of your financial goals, and before making big purchases, take a day or two to think it through.</p> <ol> <li>6. The Gambler</li> </ol> <ul> <li>The thrill of risk and reward gives them a high&nbsp;</li> <li>Tends to gamble their money away and take high risks</li> <li>Shares common traits with Money-Makers and Spenders</li> </ul> <p><strong>Negative:</strong> When the gambling gets out of control and has them risking their savings and investments, it could lead to their financial downfall.</p> <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Take calculated risks.

    title: "Simplify your Finances by automating",
    description:
      "<p>The best way to consistently save and invest is through automating your finances. If you often forget bill payments, lack proper planning, or fail to save adequately, consider automating your money.</p> <strong>What does automating your finances involve?</strong> <p>Automating your finances means setting up automatic bill payments and savings contributions, eliminating the need for manual handling. For example, when you subscribe to Netflix, there is a monthly payment deduction to your account. Imagine setting up a system similar to that, where payments are systematically scheduled on a specific date each month. Essentially, by automating your finances, you make your life easier while not falling back on your obligations. </p> <p> Now that you have a better idea of what automating your money involves, let’s move on to the significant psychological benefit of automating your finances. </p> <p>We are inherently inclined to want things right away rather than later. We struggle with fighting off immediate rewards in favor of those that are often more gratifying and long-lasting. Automating your finances removes the stress of having to constantly make financial decisions and helps you curb impulse spending. By automating your bill payments, there’s no space for premature self-gratifying thoughts like “I already saved last month” and “Oh no, I’m not going to have enough to save if I pay this bill right now”. This disciplined approach also reduces the financial stress of choosing between immediate spending and saving, and it prevents you from forgetting to pay your bills. </p> <strong>Here’s how you do it!</strong> <ol> <li> <p><strong>1. Automatic transfers</strong></p> <p>First, you need to have a current account where your income is deposited. Selecting the right bank is crucial: consider transaction costs, account fees, and late payment charges. Additionally, consider a bank that offers networking and advisory benefits, a bank that can help you grow in knowledge and networks. Set up a standing order with your bank where to issue payments to your creditors or service provider. Provide your bank with the account numbers and addresses for your fixed expenses, and they will deduct these payments automatically each month.</p> <p> You can automate your bill payments. These include: </p> <ul> <li> <p>Loans</p> </li> <li> <p>Insurance</p> </li> <li> <p>Mortgage /rent</p> </li> <li> <p>Utilities</p> </li> <li> <p>School fees</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>2. Through your employer</strong></p> <p> If setting up automatic transfers is an option for you, it’s even better if your employer offers direct deposit options. So, how does that work? </p> <p> In Kenya, employers normally deduct and remit PAYE, NHIF and NSSF. If you are in a Sacco, you can request for it to be deducted from your pay slip. In the United States, you can request your employer to automatically deduct a certain percentage of your pre-tax income for retirement contributions each pay period. If your employer offers this, then you can request that a portion of your salary goes directly to your savings, retirement accounts, or towards bill payments. </p> <p> Wouldn’t it be better if your contributions to savings and bills were all automatically deducted and dispatched from your pay? Then all you receive is the rest of your income to your current account. It’s a convenient way to make sure your financial obligations are met without effort. </p> <p> Alternatively, you can set up transfers with your bank into a savings account if doing it via your employer is not an option. </p> </li> </ol> <p> <strong>By automating your savings and investments:</strong> </p> <ul> <li> <p>Retirement</p> </li> <li> <p>Long-term savings/investment accounts</p> </li> <li> <p>Short-term savings</p> </li> <li> <p>Emergency Fund</p> </li> </ul> <p> By automating your savings and investments, the deposits are made automatically without you having to contemplate with present bias or forgetting to make the transfers. This automatic approach of setting up regular transfers to the above savings and investment accounts ensures you consistently building your financial future. </p> <p> For those with irregular income, use calendar reminders to initiate transfers to savings and investments upon receiving payment or confirmation of its arrival. If you regularly set aside a fixed monthly amount, consider automating transfers via a standing order at your bank. Opt for an amount you can consistently afford, ensuring financial discipline during all months, prosperous or challenging, as this helps steadily build your savings and investments. Then, when your income increases, you can make additional transfers. Automating your finances is the best decision if you aspire to be consistent in paying bills, saving and/or investing. It might take a little time to set up, however you are more likely to stick to your financial goals, pay bills on time, and achieve them faster by adopting this new financial habit. Therefore, start automating your finances ASAP if you are in a position to do so, avoid late fees, and work with ease towards your financial success. </p> <p> This article is edited by Saba, </p> <img src='/image1.jpg' alt='Saba Pinard' style='width: 100px; height: 100px; border-radius: 50%;' /> <p> Saba Pinard is a French-Ethiopian professional who specializes in French<>English Translation.

This was the first of its kind that I have done before in order to keep track of my spending habits and focus on what is a necessity rather than a want. The 10 days really accomplished this and helped me not only realize how many non-budget spendings I do, but also how I need to build consistency in making a budget and sticking to it. This challenge gave me great next steps (learning how to budget effectively being the main one) to take to be able to manage my finances well. What resources or advice do you have in regards to budgeting? I have seen your posts on figuring finance and would definitely like to lean into them. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed the stretch this challenge gave - didn't feel impossible but definitely pushed and brought a much needed challenge. Thank you again for spearheading this!
