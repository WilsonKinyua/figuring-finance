    title: "Let’s Talk about the 8th wonder of the world",
    description:
      "<p>Albert Einstein once said “Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. <strong>He who understands it, earns it; he who doesn’t, pays it.”</strong></p><p>Trust me, it’s easier to understand than you think it is not some financial technical term, it’s a pretty easy concept and knowing it will help you grow your money, think long-term and help you think harder before jumping into any “good” sounding debt (we’ll get more into that another day).</p><p>To keep it simple compound interest is interest on your interest. Simple interest is the amount earned at the end of the year the principal plus interest.</p><p>for example, 100,000 ksh in your savings earning 2% interest rate per annum and you leave it for one year (bank interest rates are quite low) so at the end of the year your money is at 102,00 KSH you’re probably hardly batting an eyelid at that interest rate. The problem with this, is if you are looking to save and not touch that money anytime soon than it isn’t doing much for you because your money is not beating the inflation rate, your money is losing value over time. That is something to consider look into money market funds (pretty low risk) which give better interest rates currently from 6-10% per annum (that’s way better than 2% right?) especially if you’re not looking to touch the money for some time.</p><p>But, compound interest is when you consistently leave the 100,000 KSH to grow and earn interest on your interest. That is when you start seeing the money rolling in and doesn’t it feel awesome! You are basically earning free money it does not get better than that! Before you start balling out you have to pace yourself it takes some time and you got to play for the long-term for example:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2% interest per annum:</strong></p><p>Year 1: 100,000 KSH &nbsp; = 102,000 KSH</p><p>Year 2: 102,000 KSH &nbsp; = 104,040 KSH</p><p>Year 3: 104,040 KSH &nbsp; = 106,121. KSH</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>8% interest per annum:</strong></p><p>Year 1: 100,000 KSH&nbsp; = 108,000 KSH</p><p>Year 2: 108,000 KSH&nbsp; = 116,640 KSH</p><p>Year 3: 125,971 KSH&nbsp; = 125,971 KSH</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The great words of Warren Buffett <strong>“If you don’t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.”</strong></p><p>This sounds cool, how does it work?</p><p>Compound interest accumulates over time and the more money you deposit the higher the interest rate which is the better for you! The key is to keep adding to your principal per month or bi-weekly or if you’re a lump-sum type of person than planning to deposit bigger amounts quarterly or every half-of the year. Being consistent is key and when the account starts looking juicy remember the goal for that money. Avoid aimlessly saving have a purpose for that saving or else you may be tempted to aimlessly spend.</p><p>I hope this makes compound interest simpler to understand and that it gets you excited to start making it work for you.&nbsp; Remember, to keep adding to your principal, consistency and patience will take you a mighty long way. The best time to start investing was yesterday the next best time is today.</p>",

    title: "3 Bad Debts to Watch",
    description:
      "<p>Debt simply refers to the state of owing money; this can either be to a person or an institution. Contrary to popular belief, not all debt is bad, but we shall get into that in a later article.</p><p>Let’s begin with a disclaimer, shall we? There is no shame around getting into bad debt because life happens. Holding on to the guilt and shame of being in debt only drags one down and discourages them from making better decisions.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What is bad debt?</strong></p><p>Simply put, it is debt that gives no lasting value; it loses its value the moment you get it. Meaning, whatever the bad debt is, it does not appreciate nor gain profit to give you more than what you borrowed.</p><p>Here are some examples:</p><ol><li><strong>1. Credit Cards</strong></li></ol><p>Disclaimer: Not all credit card debt is bad!&nbsp;</p><p>A credit card can help build up your credit score, which is useful when looking to get a mortgage or bigger loan for purposes such as business. Having a healthy relationship with credit generally does good than harm in the long run.</p><p>However, if not used wisely, it can be detrimental to your financial wellness. The thing about credit cards is that they give you instant access to your desires, without having to think long and hard about it. Therefore, without any discipline, it can be a slippery slope of poor impulsive decisions.&nbsp;</p><p>Having knowledge of the interest rate on the credit card plus any extra interest from late fees is crucial. In fact, if more individuals had an idea of how costly this can get, many of us would think twice about owning credit cards.&nbsp;</p><p>Pro Tip: The best way to avoid incurring extra credit costs is to pay the balance before the due date to avoid any interest, if possible, or making extra payments to help keep your interest charge low.</p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Payday Loans&nbsp;</strong></p><p>This refers to taking out a short-term loan to get you through a difficult time, with the knowledge that payday is just around the corner (perhaps two weeks away). In the moment, when the pressure is high, it does not seem like a horrible idea.&nbsp;</p><p>Consequently, you post-date a cheque in the hope that you will pay back once you receive your salary. Seems harmless, right? Well, WRONG! The catch with these payday loans is that the interest charged is quite high&nbsp; in such a short time.</p><p>Taking these loans frequently is an expensive affair that should be avoided at all costs.&nbsp;</p><p>Pro Tip: Consider building an emergency fund to help cushion you in tough times to avoid getting into debt that does not add value.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; <strong>3. Auto-mobile Loans&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A brother/sister has got to get to work, right? Having a car will make transportation generally easier. However, when taking out a loan to purchase a car, it is easy to be swayed by luxury cars, rather than sticking to what you originally had in mind.&nbsp;</p><p>Although the interest rates for an auto loan are usually low, remember to take into consideration that a car is a depreciating asset, therefore, what you get it for is not what you will be able to sell it for.&nbsp;</p><p>Pro Tip: If you are in this position, plan in advance to purchase the make and model of car that best fits within your budget, and plan to pay on time. Additionally, you are the buyer; ask as many questions as you would like and get to know if there are any additional (hidden) fees aside from the interest rate.</p><p>Do your research before getting into any of the above debts, not necessarily avoiding them like the plague but being careful what it is your getting yourself into, make sure it works for you and won’t leave you in a pile of high interest debt.</p>",

    description:
      "<p>You could be the best at spotting opportunities, but the worst at being patient in riding out the ups and downs of your investments. By identifying your money personality, you are able to understand and embrace your emotional responses, beliefs and behaviour towards money, learning how to improve the not-so-good aspects.

This means losing out on good investment opportunities (there is always some risk attached to investing). They may also miss out on creating memorable experiences in an attempt to scrape every penny.</p> <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Money is energy and it must flow. Hoarding only stops this flow.

    title: "Simplify your Finances by automating",
    description:
      "<p>The best way to consistently save and invest is through automating your finances. If you often forget bill payments, lack proper planning, or fail to save adequately, consider automating your money.</p> <strong>What does automating your finances involve?</strong> <p>Automating your finances means setting up automatic bill payments and savings contributions, eliminating the need for manual handling. For example, when you subscribe to Netflix, there is a monthly payment deduction to your account. Imagine setting up a system similar to that, where payments are systematically scheduled on a specific date each month. Essentially, by automating your finances, you make your life easier while not falling back on your obligations. </p> <p> Now that you have a better idea of what automating your money involves, let’s move on to the significant psychological benefit of automating your finances. </p> <p>We are inherently inclined to want things right away rather than later. We struggle with fighting off immediate rewards in favor of those that are often more gratifying and long-lasting. Automating your finances removes the stress of having to constantly make financial decisions and helps you curb impulse spending. By automating your bill payments, there’s no space for premature self-gratifying thoughts like “I already saved last month” and “Oh no, I’m not going to have enough to save if I pay this bill right now”. This disciplined approach also reduces the financial stress of choosing between immediate spending and saving, and it prevents you from forgetting to pay your bills. </p> <strong>Here’s how you do it!</strong> <ol> <li> <p><strong>1. Automatic transfers</strong></p> <p>First, you need to have a current account where your income is deposited. Selecting the right bank is crucial: consider transaction costs, account fees, and late payment charges. Additionally, consider a bank that offers networking and advisory benefits, a bank that can help you grow in knowledge and networks. Set up a standing order with your bank where to issue payments to your creditors or service provider. Provide your bank with the account numbers and addresses for your fixed expenses, and they will deduct these payments automatically each month.</p> <p> You can automate your bill payments. These include: </p> <ul> <li> <p>Loans</p> </li> <li> <p>Insurance</p> </li> <li> <p>Mortgage /rent</p> </li> <li> <p>Utilities</p> </li> <li> <p>School fees</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>2. Through your employer</strong></p> <p> If setting up automatic transfers is an option for you, it’s even better if your employer offers direct deposit options. So, how does that work? </p> <p> In Kenya, employers normally deduct and remit PAYE, NHIF and NSSF. If you are in a Sacco, you can request for it to be deducted from your pay slip. In the United States, you can request your employer to automatically deduct a certain percentage of your pre-tax income for retirement contributions each pay period. If your employer offers this, then you can request that a portion of your salary goes directly to your savings, retirement accounts, or towards bill payments. </p> <p> Wouldn’t it be better if your contributions to savings and bills were all automatically deducted and dispatched from your pay? Then all you receive is the rest of your income to your current account. It’s a convenient way to make sure your financial obligations are met without effort. </p> <p> Alternatively, you can set up transfers with your bank into a savings account if doing it via your employer is not an option. </p> </li> </ol> <p> <strong>By automating your savings and investments:</strong> </p> <ul> <li> <p>Retirement</p> </li> <li> <p>Long-term savings/investment accounts</p> </li> <li> <p>Short-term savings</p> </li> <li> <p>Emergency Fund</p> </li> </ul> <p> By automating your savings and investments, the deposits are made automatically without you having to contemplate with present bias or forgetting to make the transfers. This automatic approach of setting up regular transfers to the above savings and investment accounts ensures you consistently building your financial future. </p> <p> For those with irregular income, use calendar reminders to initiate transfers to savings and investments upon receiving payment or confirmation of its arrival. If you regularly set aside a fixed monthly amount, consider automating transfers via a standing order at your bank. Opt for an amount you can consistently afford, ensuring financial discipline during all months, prosperous or challenging, as this helps steadily build your savings and investments. Then, when your income increases, you can make additional transfers. Automating your finances is the best decision if you aspire to be consistent in paying bills, saving and/or investing. It might take a little time to set up, however you are more likely to stick to your financial goals, pay bills on time, and achieve them faster by adopting this new financial habit. Therefore, start automating your finances ASAP if you are in a position to do so, avoid late fees, and work with ease towards your financial success. </p> <p> This article is edited by Saba, </p> <img src='/image1.jpg' alt='Saba Pinard' style='width: 100px; height: 100px; border-radius: 50%;' /> <p> Saba Pinard is a French-Ethiopian professional who specializes in French<>English Translation.

    title: "What the Finance Bill 2024, is going on?",
    description:
      "<p>The Finance Bill in Kenya is a crucial instrument for setting taxation and financial policies, managing government revenues and expenditures, and supporting the country’s economic development objectives. Therefore, it plays a key role in shaping the business environment and overall economic terrain.</p> <p>The objective of this article is to educate you on what the Finance Bill, 2024 is proposing without inputting too much personal opinion. Here is a summarized version of what you should know about the Finance Bill, 2024 (the good and bad).</p> <p><strong>Firstly, there are a few positives to highlight in the Finance Bill Kenya, 2024:</strong></p> <ul style='list-style: none;'> <li> 1. VAT exemption on transfer of businesses </li> <li> 2. Increase minimum contributions paid to pension schemes from KSH. 20,000 to KSH. 30,000. This means a bigger tax exemption from income if an individual would like to contribute KSH. 30,000 to their retirement from their income then the rest of their income is taxable. <ul> <li>For example, an individual earning KSH.100,000 and is contributing KSH.30,000 to their retirement then their taxable income is KSH. 70,000. </li> </ul> </li> <li> 3. Per diems proposes to amend the tax-free per diem from a daily maximum of KSH. 2,000 per day to an amount not exceeding 5% of the employee’s monthly gross salary. </li> <li> 4. Increasing the VAT registration threshold for taxpayers making taxable supplies from KSH. 5 million to KSH. 8 million. </li> </ul> <p><strong>Some proposed amendments have raised a lot of controversy and if the bill is passed will be challenging for many Kenyans:</strong></p> <ul style='list-style: none;'> <li> <strong>1. Motor vehicle tax to be at 2.5% of the value of the vehicle</strong> <ul> <li>This comes off as a double taxation as levies are paid for transportation within fuel costs and commercial cars pay advanced tax. </li> <li>The proposed tax coupled with higher insurance premiums (by 2.5%) and high fuel costs will negatively impact Kenya's transport and logistics industry and costs will be directed to customers. </li> <li>Another issue with the tax is private vehicles are not income generating therefore it is not clear why it should be taxed. </li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>2. The expanding of the definition of “Digital Content Monetisation” The Bill seeks to amend the definition for purposes of determining income deemed to be accrued or derived from Kenya to mean:</strong> <ul> <li> An online or electronic platform that enables a person to sell or provide goods, property, or services including - <ul> <li>Ride-hailing services</li> <li>Food delivery services</li> <li>Freelance services</li> <li>Professional services</li> <li>Rental services</li> <li>Task-based services</li> <li>Any other service that is not exempt from tax under the Income Tax Act</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>3. Tax on pension and retirement schemes the schemes (firms) will be subject to a tax which translates to lower returns for contributors</strong> </li> <li> <strong>4. Introduction of a significant economic presence tax: this applies to non-residents the SEP tax would be levied on income earned by non-residents from business carried out over a digital marketplace.</strong> <ul> <li> The SEP tax rate shall be 30% of the deemed taxable profit. The deemed taxable profit shall be 20% of the gross turnover earned by a non-resident person. </li> <li> This may affect our non-resident digital marketplace as neighbouring countries such as Uganda and Tanzania (with fewer taxes) become more affordable to grow digitally. </li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>5. Tax on interest income of infrastructure bonds</strong> <ul> <li>Infrastructure bonds have always been tax-exempt and it is unclear if the tax applies to only corporate infrastructure bonds, or also government infrastructure bonds that have become more and more popular. </li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>6. Taxation of family trusts</strong> <ul> <li>The tax exemptions for family trusts would be removed translating to taxes on making money in a trust and transferring funds or properties in a trust. </li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>7. All businesses must comply with eTims and failure to do so results in a heavy KSH. 2 million penalty</strong> </li> <li> <strong>8. The bill proposes to exclude the following certain financial services from VAT exemptions:</strong> <ul> <li>Issuing of debit and credit cards, Telegraphic money services such as Mpesa, foreign exchange transactions, cheque handling, processing and clearing, issuance of securities for money, etc.. </li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>9. Change in VAT treatment for materials used in packaging and labelling products</strong> </li> <li> <strong>10. Change of VAT of goods and services used by local film producers </strong> <ul> <li> VAT on goods imported or purchased locally for use by local film producers and filming agents. The bill also proposes to subject VAT on services imported or procured locally by the film producers or agents. </li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>11. Change in VAT for bread</strong> <ul> <li>This has led to much controversy as bread is an essential day-to-day product in Kenya. The proposed amendment will affect the consumption of bread by many Kenyans, especially the low-income bracket. </li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>12. The Eco Levy</strong> <ul> <li> The levy seeks to include charges on importing specific goods such as cameras, machines, phones, diapers, etc.. </li> <li> The Eco Levy will be at a cost per unit per item indicated in the finance bill, 2024 </li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>13. Amendments within the Procedures Act</strong> <ul> <li>If the proposed bill is passed this gives KRA the right in a court case with an individual to go ahead and freeze their accounts even before the case is settled. </li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>14. Amendment to Data Protection Act</strong> <ul> <li>The amendment will allow KRA to have access to information that is considered private such as individuals' bank account information, mobile messages, and phone calls in the case they suspect the individual is not paying taxes. </li> <li>The problems with this is the breach of individual privacy, and can this level of access to private personal information be abused? and if so, what that would look like for Kenyans? </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p><strong>A few challenges with the Finance Bill,2024 have been voiced:</strong></p> <ul style='list-style: none;'> <li> <ul> <li>From last year the Finance Bill, 2023 which made tax adjustments with the promise to decrease national loans however we have borrowed more as a country than the previous regime.</li> <li>The worrisome factors that affect day-to-day consumption such as the VAT on bread making life more expensive for the average Kenyan; including the packaging for products increasing this is still not clear how it will affect the day-to-day products such as sugar, flour, rice, water. </li> <li>The problem from the previous finance bill 2023 and the tax amendments is there was no transparency as to how much the government made and what it was spent on. </li> <li>Another issues is the effect on foreign investors, our neighbouring countries will be more affordable to invest in with lower taxes and also a growing economy. </li> <li>In summary, the finance bill, 2024 if passed will intensify the financial burden of Kenyans and will heavily affect day-today life, businesses, and foreign investors. There are positives in the Bill, however it is evident that the bad outweighs the good. We hope to have transparency on how tax funds are utilized and how Kenyans can be more economically supported through taxation and financial policies. </li> </ul> </li> </ul>",

    title: "Before you say “I Do”: Financial Conversations to have before marriage",
    description:
      "<p> The person you marry is the #1 most important financial decision you will ever make </p> <p> Marriage is a beautiful commitment, a promise to stand by each other <q>for better or for worse.</q> It’s more than a wedding or a beautiful ring—it’s a union of values, where you accept someone fully, with all their strengths, quirks, and yes, financial baggage. Sometimes, though, we get so wrapped up in the excitement of marriage that we overlook the practical aspects, especially the financial ones. Beyond love and companionship, the person you marry will shape your financial journey and outcomes. </p> <p> According to Forbes Advisor, in the U.S., 43% of first marriages and 60% of second marriages end in divorce, often due to money issues. Choosing a partner is arguably the most impactful financial choice you’ll make. Here are a few key financial discussions to consider before you say, “I do.” </p> <ol> <li> <p> <strong> 1. Do You Share Life Goals and Vision?</strong> </p> <p> You might be perfect for each other, but what if your life goals don’t align? Picture this: you’re passionate about traveling, experiencing different cultures, and maybe even working abroad someday. You’ve budgeted for these adventures, and they’re part of your dream. Meanwhile, your partner dreams of settling down, buying a home early, and building a close-knit community. They prioritize stability, with a focus on career, homeownership, and family life. </p> <p> While both visions are valid, they represent different paths that could lead to conflicts over spending, saving, and lifestyle priorities. Without shared goals—or at least compromise—one partner may feel pressured to give up their dreams, which can breed resentment over time. </p> <p> It’s also important to discuss long-term plans. For example, if one partner plans to return to school or take time off to raise children, this will impact both household income and future earning potential. </p> <p> In the book The Millionaire Next Door, interviews with millionaires revealed that many had supportive, frugal partners who shared their vision of building wealth together. This shows just how vital it is to be on the same page to work toward shared dreams. </p> <p> Discussing life goals openly and finding ways to support each other’s aspirations can prevent these issues before they start, helping both partners feel fulfilled while working toward a shared future. </p> </li> <li> <p> <strong> 2. Share Your Current Financial Situation</strong> </p> <p> Before you say, “till death do us part,” be transparent about your financial situation. Your debt, income, and financial responsibilities become part of your partner’s life, too. How will you build wealth together if your spouse doesn’t know your financial capabilities? The strength of marriage lies in partnership, but that starts with transparency about your finances. It’s also worth considering trust. </p> <p> You’d rather share debts beforehand than have your spouse find out later and feel blindsided, which can strain trust in the relationship. </p> </li> <li> <p> <strong> 3. Are Your Lifestyle Choices Aligned?</strong> </p> <p> Sometimes, it’s the little things that add up. Lifestyle differences can create friction. Opposites might attract, but they also need to be willing to meet halfway. If one partner loves luxury or frequent dining out while the other prefers frugality, it can lead to tension. Compromise can bring balance. The spendthrift can learn to save more consistently, while the frugal partner might learn to enjoy life a bit more. </p> <p> Before marrying, consider whether your partner shares similar lifestyle choices or is willing to compromise. Creating a household budget that includes discretionary spending for each partner can help. Setting spending limits or having “fun money” budgets can maintain a healthy balance between lifestyle and financial responsibility. </p> </li> <li> <p> <strong> 4. Do You Agree on “The Big Stuff”?</strong> </p> <p> Big decisions, like buying a home, starting a family, or relocating, require mutual agreement and planning. Many marital issues stem from unspoken expectations, and these big milestones impact your joint finances. Discussing your expectations around these decisions helps both partners prepare financially and emotionally. </p> <p> Building an emergency fund is also essential for unforeseen events, such as illness or job loss. This fund helps protect you from life’s uncertainties and safeguard your future plans. </p> <img src='/2.jpg' style='height: 50vh; width: 100%;object-fit:contain;margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:10px;' alt='Do You Agree on “The Big Stuff”?'> </li> <li> <p> <strong> 5. Discuss Savings, Investments, and Risk Tolerance</strong> </p> <p> Couples often have different levels of comfort with investment risk. One may prefer conservative investing, while the other leans toward high-risk, high-reward strategies. The same goes for saving—one partner might save aggressively, while the other saves more casually. Setting savings goals, like for a property or investment fund, and agreeing on an investment strategy are key to building wealth together. </p> <p> Couples aligned on financial goals and investment strategies are often better positioned to grow wealth and handle market ups and downs together. </p> </li> <li> <p> <strong> 6. Building a Financially Transparent Relationship </strong> </p> <p> Financial transparency builds trust. This means being honest about current debts and assets and creating a habit of regular check-ins to review your budget, investments, and goals. Routine check-ins foster a sense of partnership and create a shared vision. Financial openness also gives each partner confidence that they’re on the same page. </p> <p> Some couples find it helpful to schedule monthly or quarterly “financial check-ins” to review the budget, savings, and upcoming expenses. These check-ins build accountability and help partners stay aligned. </p> </li> </ol> <p> In conclusion, the person you marry impacts not only your lifestyle but also your path to financial security. Entering a marriage blind to someone’s financial situation, vision, and lifestyle choices can lead to unexpected challenges. Money conversations might not be the most fun, but they’re vital for fostering a shared vision and open communication. A marriage built on financial alignment provides a foundation for shared prosperity, allowing both partners to pursue their dreams and thrive together. </p>",

    title: "7 Easy Tips for a Holiday Budget",
    description:
      "<p> The holiday season is almost here! It’s that magical (and expensive) time of year when we go all out—hosting loved ones, buying gifts, attending events, and, well, spending more than usual. </p> <p> I don’t know about you, but I tend to overspend during the holidays. And then January hits like a financial hangover! If you’re not feeling totally prepared financially, don’t worry—you’ve still got time to get things in order. Here are some simple, actionable tips to help you get ready for the season! </p> <ol> <li> <p> <strong> 1. List Holiday Expenses:</strong> </p> <p> Beyond your usual budget the holiday season brings some special categories you’ll want to account for. Go through your budget and think about the holiday-specific costs that might pop up, like: </p> <ul> <li><p>Extra childcare or day care costs</p></li> <li><p>Gifts</p></li> <li><p>Higher transportation costs</p></li> <li><p>Increased utilities (hello, extra holiday lights!)</p></li> <li><p>Event tickets</p></li> <li><p>Decorations</p></li> <li><p>Holiday shopping</p></li> </ul> <p> List these out to get a better sense of what’s coming. </p> </li> <li> <p> <strong> 2. Set a Spending Limit:</strong> </p> <p> Unless you’re planning to be Santa Claus for everyone you know, it’s time to set a spending limit. How much are you actually comfortable spending? What’s your personal cut-off, considering your finances? A spending cap will help keep you from taking on unnecessary debt. Also, think about your “financial boundaries” for the season—like how much you’re comfortable helping loved ones with if they ask for a little extra support. </p> </li> <li> <p> <strong> 3. Prioritize Spending Categories:</strong> </p> <p> Essentials come first! Your regular expenses—like rent, utilities, and other necessary bills—should be top of mind. The holidays don’t excuse us from paying those. Once that’s settled, take a look at your holiday expenses and decide which ones matter most to you. For instance, if decorating your home for the holidays is important to you, prioritize your ornament and decoration budget accordingly! </p> <img src='/4.jpg' style='height: 100%; width: 100%;' alt='Prioritize Spending Categories'> </li> <li> <p> <strong> 4. Target Sales:</strong> </p> <p> Black Friday and other holiday sales can help you save a lot—if you’re strategic about it. Instead of getting swept away and ending up with random stuff, make a list of items you actually need and wait for them to go on sale. Say you’re in the market for a new mattress because your back can’t take one more night on your old one—try snagging it during the sales! Align your big expenses with big discounts. </p> </li> <li> <p> <strong> 5. Create Sinking Funds:</strong> </p> <p> Wondering what a “sinking fund” is? It’s just a fancy term for separate savings accounts or funds set aside for specific costs. For example, you could set one up for holiday shopping and another for gift-giving. These funds help you stay organized and intentional with your money. Plus, they create a natural spending limit for each category! </p> </li> <li> <p> <strong> 6. Let’s Be Real:</strong> </p> <p> Keep your holiday budget realistic. If deep down you know you can’t afford it all, scale back. The holidays come and go every year—no need to go all out and find yourself struggling come January. Leave a little wiggle room in your budget, too; flexibility will help keep things stress-free. </p> </li> <li> <p> <strong> 7. Add Expenses to Your Budget and Track Spending:</strong> </p> <p> I know tracking spending isn’t the most exciting holiday activity, but it’ll save you from post-holiday stress! A budget tells your money where to go, which will be especially helpful with all the extra spending. Keep checking in to stay on top of your finances and avoid the January blues. </p> </li> </ol> <p> In conclusion, it’s definitely not too late to start on your holiday budget. With a little planning, you can feel more in control, manage your expenses, and avoid debt. The key is to stick to your budget and spending limits, and if you slip a little, catch yourself before it goes too far. And remember, there’s always next year—no need to stretch yourself thin just to make this one perfect! </p>",

      "Hello, I trust that you are well. I would like to take this opportunity by saying Thank-you so so much, the no spend challenge taught me how to be disciplined with my money. I was able to keep track of how much I was spending as making a wholesale purchase of food rather from the supermarket getting vegetables at the market , asking myself over and over do I really want to purchase certain items or do I really need these Items. And lastly i really did save more! The Challenge was great hope to have more and more coming. Thank you once again Manuella Kind Regards",

      "Hi Njambi! I hope you are doing well and are having a good week! Thank you again for putting on the 10-day No Spend Challenge. This was the first of its kind that I have done before in order to keep track of my spending habits and focus on what is a necessity rather than a want. The 10 days really accomplished this and helped me not only realize how many non-budget spendings I do, but also how I need to build consistency in making a budget and sticking to it. This challenge gave me great next steps (learning how to budget effectively being the main one) to take to be able to manage my finances well. What resources or advice do you have in regards to budgeting? I have seen your posts on figuring finance and would definitely like to lean into them. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed the stretch this challenge gave - didn't feel impossible but definitely pushed and brought a much needed challenge. Thank you again for spearheading this! Have a great week and I look forward to hearing from you! Best,",

Also, I've been focusing on some of the indicators you mentioned and I've been able to manage one person that constantly asks me for cash. I don't think he likes my new approach very much but its helping. Thank you so much for all your help. ",
